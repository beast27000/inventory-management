for erros faced in the menu button part of the code the improper over lap the erro can be reqtified in the following two files 

a) the Nvabar folder ( within client folder) : - FILE NAME :index.tsx 
b) the Sidebar folder ( within client folder) : - FILE NAME :index.tsx( same file names)


the following code snippet is where you can rectify error in side bar folder ,
you will find similar code snippet in nav bar as well pls modify the "py and px values to see if it works "


   const sidebarClassName = `fixed flex flex-col ${
        isSidebarCollapsed ? "w-0 md:w-16" : "w-80 md:w-72"
    } bg-white transition-all duration-300 h-full shadow-md z-40`;

    return (
        <div className={sidebarClassName}>
            {/* TOP LOGO AND TOGGLE BUTTON */}
            <div
                className={`flex gap-3 justify-between md:justify-normal items-center pt-8 ${
                    isSidebarCollapsed ? "px-4" : "px-8"
                }`}
            >




LAST RESORT 

IN navbar , in index.tsx   , go ahhead and remove the following 2 lines 

a) className="ml-auto px-3 py-3 bg-gray-100 rounded-full hover:bg-blue-100 z-50" // Added z-index for visibility
   onClick={toggleSidebar}

   (it is winthin button , pls don't remove that , just leave it blank)

b) <Menu className="w-6 h-6" /> {/* Increased icon size */}

from the lines 36 and 37 for (a) and line 39

(THIS WIL MAKE SURE MENUE BUTTON IS ERASED FROM THE NAV BAR BUT SINCE SIDE BAR'S MENUE BUTTON STILL EXISTS IT IS SOMEWHAT OK , ATLEST NOT AS BAD LOOKING AS TWO NON-SUPERIMPOSED BUTTONS )
